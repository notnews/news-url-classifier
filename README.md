"Finally, we point curious researchers to the paths of URLs, which often contain human-readable  text  similar  to  titles.   For  example,  from  the  URL https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/01/boris-johnson-swimming-pool-newts-oxfordshire, one could use “boris johnson swimming pool newts oxfordshire” as input for an NLP classifier. Although we know of no studies doing so, this seems like an intriguing possibility."
